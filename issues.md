# Issues: 
### 1.Render Projects from Backend CSV

**Description:**
Projects tab should load and display all projects from a backend CSV file with accurate details and in the correct order.

2. Fetch the data on the frontend when loading the Projects tab.
3. Display each project with correct details (title, description, etc.).
4. Ensure projects are sorted correctly (e.g., by date or status).
5. Add error handling for empty or invalid CSV data.

### 2.Image Not Showing Up on the Project Page

**Description:**
Images in the project are not rendering or appearing on the frontend. This could be due to incorrect file paths, missing images, or issues with the image component on the frontend.

2. Check the image tag and inspect the source using the browserâ€™s Developer Tools (Inspect > Network tab).

### 3.Missing "Forgot Password" Option for Account Recovery

2. Observe that there is no "Forgot Password" or "Forgot Username" option for account recovery.


### 4.Form Validation Not Triggering
